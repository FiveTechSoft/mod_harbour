* Added function Math_E() The base of natural logarithms. To be used for Neural Networks (amongst other possible uses)

2020/May/22

* Multiple SetCookie() support

2020/May/21

* New environment variable MHTIMEOUT. By default is 15 seconds. You can set it from the httpd.conf file this way:

SetEnv MHTIMEOUT "30"

2020/April/29

* Cache temporarly removed. We are doing more tests.

* New GitHub actions to automatically build mod_harbour for Linux.

2020/April/27

* New PRGs into HRBs automatic cache implemented. This technique was originally implemented, in the xbase world, by FoxBase+
and later ported to FoxPro. Now mod_harbour automatically avoid the need to recompile when there are no changes
in the source code. If there is a change, mod_harbour recompiles and updates the cache.

2020/April/15

* New function AP_HeadersOut() same as there is a AP_HeadersIn(). IIS support also.

2020/April/06

* New: function AP_GetPairs() provides similar functionality as AP_PostPairs(). Parameters must
  be provided like this example: index.prg?one=first&two=second&three=third. Example: ? AP_GetPairs() 

* Enhanced function AP_RPuts() support for arrays, hashes and objects. In example: ? AP_HeadersIn()

2020/March/10

* mod_harbour for IIS no longer needs to copy any DLLs to a specific place. They are used from
  the same folder where mod_harbour.dll is placed.

2020/March/04

* Cookies management functions added in libharbour.dll
  + function SetCookie( cName, cValue, nSecs, cPath, cDomain, lHttps, lOnlyHttp )
  + function GetCookies() --> hCookies (hash value)

2020/February/18

* New version 2.0
  + Concurrency support. To test it: 
    c:\Apache24\bin\ab -n 100 -c 10  http://localhost/modharbour_samples/info.prg
    
  + Timeouts control (15 secs max)
  
  + MultiThreading support

2019/August/30

* New examples using 3D three.js module. Please review samples/three folder

2019/July/2

* Fix: BLOCKS ... ENDTEXT was not properly working as ReplaceBlocks() was returning a logical value. ReplaceBlocks()
  now detects if the first parameter is supplied by reference and if not, the text value is returned instead of a
  logical value. samples/blocks.prg is properly working.

2019/July/1

* Fix: Header files were not applied to the preprocessor. Now they are ok. Please notice that you may set HB_INCLUDE
  to specify your headers files path. 
  
  // {% hb_SetEnv( "HB_INCLUDE", "/home/user/harbour/include" ) %}  Place this at the top of your PRG

2019/June/23

* New functions:
   + PathBase( [cPathFileName] ) --> returns the computer folder where the app is located, or where a file is located
   + PathUrl() --> returns the url of the app 
   + Include( cPathFileName ) --> includes a file from the computer relative to where the app is located
   
2019/June/15

* Fixed function AP_SetContentType() (please review samples/json.prg using PostMan utility). When a 
  constant string is to be set from harbour into the mod, we need to create a copy of it using the
  memory API of the mod.
  
2019/June/14

* New samples/apps/honey developed by Carles Aubia, its a great example using MVC (model-view-controller)
  with mod_harbour. Don't miss to review it.

2019/June/13

* New function ReplaceBlocks( cCode ) searches for {{ ... }} and if found, it macroexpands its containt
  before calling the harbour preprocessor. apache.prg sets an environment variable PRGPATH that you can
  use before compiling your PRGs, in example: #include '{{hb_GetEnv("PRGPATH")}}/a2.prg' This way we can 
  use relative paths in the includes.

2019/June/12

* Enhancement: command ? only calls AP_RPuts() once

* We have started a how-to guide (readme.md) for mod_harbour on OSX

* mod_harbour.c can also be compiled using MinGW gcc 32 bits from Windows 32
  ( we advise not to use gcc for Windows as it uses many DLLs)
  
* New samples: setcookie.prg and getcookie.prg thanks to Carles Aubia!  


2019/June/11

* We start this ChangeLog.txt to comment all changes

* AP_RPuts() was sending a <br>, now the <br> is issued by the ? command

* In order to implement AP_Body() the call to ap_parse_form_data() had to be removed as it was emptying the body
  after the call. AP_Body() also empties the body after reading it, so in order to keep its value, from apache.prg
  we keep a low level static char * szBody to keep a copy of it. Next calls to AP_Body() returns this copy
  
* A new function AP_PostPairs() in PRG level replaces the previous low level AP_PostPairs(). This new function can
  be tested from samples/post.prg that makes a call to samples/postpairs.prg
  
* Fix: After the new function AP_PostPairs(), the text that we receive (i.e. from samples/run.prg) is url-encoded.
  So we have implemented a new function hb_UrlDecode() to do the right transformation. hb_UrlDecode() is renamed
  Giancarlo Nicolai's Tip_UrlDecode()
  
* In the past days:
  + we unified the source code for both Linux and Windows
  + We are able to include contribs libs in libharbour.(dll or so) or to include your own libs
