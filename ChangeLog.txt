* We start this ChangeLog.txt to comment all changes

* In order to implement AP_Body() the call to ap_parse_form_data() had to be removed as it was emptying the body
  after the call. AP_Body() also empties the body after reading it, so in order to keep its value, from apache.prg
  we keep a low level static char * szBody to keep a copy of it. Next calls to AP_Body() returns this copy
  
* A new function AP_PostPairs() in PRG level replaces the previous low level AP_PostPairs(). This new function can
  be tested from samples/post.prg that makes a call to samples/postpairs.prg
