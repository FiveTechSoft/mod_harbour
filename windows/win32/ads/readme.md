Download ADS SDK 32 bits from here:

https://devzone.advantagedatabase.com/dz/content.aspx?key=20&Release=19&Product=25&Platform=12

We keep a backup here:
https://github.com/FiveTechSoft/harbour_and_xharbour_builds/blob/master/adswin_x86_32.exe

**IMPORTANT:**

ADS DLLs must be copied to c:\Apache24\bin folder so mod_harbour can work. If you don't copy them, you will get a message
that libharbour.dll can't be loaded.

If you are going to use **ADS 32 bits** then you have to install **Apache 32 bits** !!!

If you are going to use **ADS 64 bits** then you have to install **Apache 64 bits** !!!

Don't mix 64 and 32 bits DLLs or it won't work !!!
