This blog example uses the MVC (model view controller) technology and it has been entirely coded using Harbour and Bootstrap for the GUI.

In the view folders there are the views that are dynamically combined to deliver the requested pages to the user.
These views are simply HTML portions but if you carefully review them, you will see how Harbour code is embedded into them.

A simple blog engine that shows how powerfull mod_harbour is. Enjoy it!
